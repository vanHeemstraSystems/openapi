# 100 - Introduction

An open API, also called public API, is an application programming interface made publicly available to software developers. Open APIs are published on the internet and shared freely, allowing the owner of a network-accessible service to give a universal access to consumers.

Swagger tools, once written, can help you advance your API development in a variety of ways:


Users who prioritize design: To create a server stub for your API, utilize Swagger Codegen. Only the server logic needs to be implemented, and your API is ready to go live!

Swagger Codegen can produce packages in over 40 languages for your API.

Swagger UI allows you to create immersive API documentation that allows your users to try out API requests in the browser.

Integrate API-related tools to your API using the spec. Import the standard into SoapUI, for example, to perform automated API tests.
